## What is a Knowledge Graph?

Node A and Node B here are two different entities. 
These nodes are connected by an edge that represents the relationship between the two nodes. Now, this is the smallest knowledge graph we can build – it is also known as a triple.

Knowledge Graph’s come in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
For example, the knowledge graph of Wikidata had 59,910,568 nodes by October 2019.


### Example of a knowledge graph 

A node or an entity can have multiple relations as well. 
Putin is not only the President of Russia, he also worked for the Soviet Union’s security agency, KGB.

The new relationships can emerge not only from the first node but from any node in a knowledge graph as shown below:
